I would really appreciate any contributing to this crate. However there are some things that are handy to know.

## How it works
Crossterm is using ANSI escape codes by default for both Unix and Windows systems. 
But for Windows, it is a bit more complicated since Windows versions 8 or lower are not supporting ANSI escape codes. 
This is why we use WinApi for those machines. 

## Architecture
Here I will discuss the architecture of crossterm. At first we will discuss the five modules crossterm has like: cursor, input, style, terminal, write. 

### The different modules

If you would like to contribute to Crossterm, than please design the code as it is now. 
For example, a module like cursor has the following file structure:
- mod.rs

  This file contains some trait, in this case, `ITerminalCursor`, for other modules to implement. So that it can work at a specific platform.
  
- cursor.rs

  The end user will call this module to access the cursor functionalities. This module will decide which implementation to use based on the current platform.
- winapi_cursor

  This is the cursor trait (located in mod.rs) implementation with WinApi.
- ansi_cursor

  This is the cursor trait (located in mod.rs) implementation with ANSI escape codes.
  
The above structure is the same for the terminal, color, manager modules. 

Why I have chosen for this design:
- Because you can easily extend to multiple platforms by implementing the trait int the mod.rs.
- You keep the functionalities for different platforms separated in different files. 
- Also, you have one API the user can call like in the `cursor.rs` above. This file should be avoided to change that much. All the other code could change a lot because it has no impact on the user side.

### Kernel
The kernel is divided into to modules one containing all the windows specific logic and the other containing all the unix specific code. 
Here we will do all the unsafe system/C calls.

### Common
Here is the code located that could be used everywhere. An example is the `Screen` type. 
The user can call this but also the different modules and the kernel are using this type.
